# calculator

wanted to practice what I learned in my coding bootcamp.

- first I made a calculator app featuring ts

- sencond, I worked on a simple todo app, but I'm struggling with getting localStorage to work so 
  I might come back to this later once i learn more about building applications.
  
- third, i created a home page which links to both the calc & todo

- if you input ---666 in the calculator, it takes you back to the home page
- if you input 'get me out' in the todo, it takes you back to the home page as well.
